# Discord data summarizer
Really low quality mid script I wrote really quickly, it reads a discord data packets messages and gives you really basic information.

Gives you information on how many messages you posted, and your most chatted in channels, for the years 2020-2025 (its hardcoded im too lazy to do it better)

Doesnt give ANY information on how much time youve spent in vcs, because the file i would need to parse for that is like 4 million lines long and im NOT doing all that
